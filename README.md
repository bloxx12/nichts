# nichts

This is my personal collection of NixOS configuration files, made to be simple
to understand and (somewhat) sane. This project is and will for the forseeable
future be a work in progress, so expect regular and big changes and instability.

## Layout of this configuraton

This configuraton is split up into three sections:

- **hosts** \\ The configuratons for my different host systems.

- **modules**

- **parts** \\ I heavily rely on flake-parts and store a lot of stuff related to
  it in there. Also, here you can find me extended lib and all the packages I
  wrap.

This configuration was only made possible through the help of some amazing
people! Below are all the repositories I took inspiration from, check them out!
