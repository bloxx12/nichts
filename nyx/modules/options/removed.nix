      `isWayland` has been moved to the meta module as a read-only option that will be set internally
      based on the desktop environments the host is running, and can no longer be set manually. Please
      move to using `modules.usrEnv.desktop` and `modules.usrEnv.dektops.<name>.enable` instead.
