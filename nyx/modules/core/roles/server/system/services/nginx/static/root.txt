Howdy!

I'm raf, more commonly known as NotAShelf on most online spaces. This
is my personal webpage, which is actually pure plaintext due to my utmosts
disdain for modern web technologies.

Frequently Asked Questions

***

Q: What do you do for a living?

A: I am a professional sailmaker. I design, manufacture and sell sails. I also
work as a part-time Political Science instructor for the time being. Sometimes
I do digital art, other times I do sailing as a sport.

***

Q: Did you study Computer Science? Why do you know programming?

A: No, I graduated as an International Relations major. I've been teaching
myself programming and Linux system administration since 2018. I mostly enjoy
open-source software, and my primary stack (as of now) is mostly backend
development in Go. Programming is something I enjoy as a tool to help me get
from point A to point B, which is why I am interested in learning new
technologies as much as I can.

***

Q: How are the International Relations?

A: They're good, thanks for asking.

***

Q: What programming languages do you know?

A: I mostly work with JavaScript, Typescript, Go, C and Nix. I also have some
experience with Rust, C++ and Python. There are other languages I've used, but
don't really consider noteworthy. I hate PHP. PHP probably hates me back. Good.

***

Q: What do you do now?

A: I am currently working on my PhD in Political Science where I conduct
research on the impact of digital technologies on political participation and
executive functions as well as the effects of open-source software. on said
fields. I would love to go into further detail but I also would like to avoid
doxxing myself. Just know that I get the prefix of "Doctor" when I'm done.

I frequently work with Nix and NixOS, embedded programming and Linux systems
in general. I also do some web development in my free time.

If you want to contact me for any reason, you may just shoot me an email
@ raf [at] notashelf [dot] dev. In case you were unable to reach me
via email (e.g. your smtp server uses an outdated cipher, or my domain is
blacklisted by your provider), you may contact me via Matrix or Mastodon using
the links below. I am also on Discord, going by the same handle as my github
username. My public gpg key is available at https://notashelf.dev/gpg which
is also in plaintext. If you're a bot, you're probably having a field day.

On that note, please stop scraping my website. I **do not** have anything
of your interest.
