## High Level Overview

A high level overview of this monorepo, containing configurations for **all** of my machines
that are running or have ran NixOS at some point in time. As I physically cannot stop
tinkering with my configuration, nothing in this repository (including the overview sections)
should be considered final. As such, it is **not recommended to be used as a template** but
you are welcome to browse the codebase to your liking, you may find bits that are interesting
or/and useful to you.

_Before you proceed, I would like to point you towards the [credits](#credits) section below
where I pay tribute to the individuals who have contributed to this project, whether through
code reference, suggestions, bug reports, or simply moral support._

### Notable Features

[module options]: ./modules/options/style
[profiles]: ./modules/profiles
[wallpkgs]: https://github.com/notashelf/wallpkgs
[flake-parts]: https://flake.parts
[impermanence]: https://github.com/nix-community/impermanence

- **All-in-one** - Servers, desktops, laptops, virtual machines and anything you
  can think of. Managed in one place.
  - **Sane Defaults** - The modules attempt to bring the most sane defaults, while
    providing per-host toggles for conflicting choices.
  - **Flexible Modules** - Both Home-manager and NixOS modules allow users to
    retrieve NixOS or home-manager configurations from anywhere.
  - **Extensive Configuration** - Most desktop programs are configured out of the
    box and shared across hosts, with override options for per-host controls.
  - **Custom extended library** - An extended library for functions that help
    organize my system.
- **Shared Configurations** - Reduces re-used boilerplate code by sharing
  modules and profiles across hosts.
- **Fully Modular** - Utilizes NixOS' module system to avoid hard-coding any of
  the options.
  - **Profiles & Roles** - Provide serialized configuration sets and pluggables
    for easily changing large portions of configurations with less options and
    minimal imports.
  - **Detached Homes** - Home-manager configurations are able to be detached for
    non-NixOS usage.
  - **Modularized Flake Design** - With the help of [flake-parts], the flake is
    fully modular: keeping my `flake.nix` cleaner than ever.
  - **Declarative Themes** - Using my [module options], [profiles] and [wallpkgs].
    Everything theming is handled inside the flake.
  - **Tree-wide formatting** - Format files in any language with the help of devshells
    and treefmt-nix modules for flake-parts.
- **Declarative nftables firewall** - Overengineered nftables chain builder for easy
  firewall setups.
- **Personal Installation Media** - Personalized ISO images for system installation
  and recovery.
- **Secrets Management** - Manage secrets through Agenix.
- **Opt-in Impermanence** - On-demand ephemeral root using BTRFS rollbacks
  and [impermanence].
- **Encryption Ready** - Supports and actively utilizes full disk encryption.
- **Wayland First** - Leaves Xorg in the past where it belongs. Everything is
  configured around Wayland, with Xorg only as a fallback.

## Credits & Special Thanks to

My special thanks go to [fufexan](https://github.com/fufexan) for
convincing me to use NixOS and sticking around to answer my most
stupid and deranged questions, as well as my [atrocious abstractions].

And to [sioodmy](https://github.com/sioodmy) which my configuration is initially based on. The
simplicity of his configuration flake allowed me to take a foothold in the Nix world.

### Awesome People
